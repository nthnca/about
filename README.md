# [About Me](http://go.nthn.ca/me)

This is just a simple directory of some of the things I am currently interested in or
things I have done over the years. You can also (very occasionally) find me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nthnca).

## Documentation

- [Family Recipes (Food)](https://github.com/nthnca/recipes/blob/master/README.md) - Using
  github for this makes it easy to add/update/organize these over time. Also allows us to
  share these with our children/family/friends.
- [Chrome Book Setup](ChromeBook.md)
- [Go Hints and Tips](GitHintsAndTips.md)
- [Cloud Machine Setup](NewDevMachine.md)
- [Dev Machine Setup](setup.sh)

## Environment Configuration

- [My VIM configuration](https://github.com/nthnca/dotvim)
- [My bash/linux configuration](https://github.com/nthnca/dotbash)

## Programming

- [URL Shortener](https://github.com/nthnca/customurls/blob/master/README.md) - This is a
  simple URL shortener that runs on AppEngine. I use this all the time, for example you
  probably followed the link http://go.nthn.ca/me to get to this page. I use shortened
  links all the time because if you give links easy to remember names it saves a
  significant amount of time. Also it is easy to set things up so that in Chrome all I
  have to type is "go me", and it automatically just works, awesome.
- [Curator](https://github.com/nthnca/curator) - Simple little tool for managing my
  photos. Clunky but works for me.
  - [Object Store](https://github.com/nthnca/object-store)
  - [Upload and Delete](https://github.com/nthnca/upload-and-delete)
- [Discord Bot](https://github.com/nthnca/discordbot) - Doesn't do much, just playing
  around here.
- [Datastore Interface](https://github.com/nthnca/datastore) - Creates a consistent API
  between normal and AppEngine interface.
- [Containers](https://github.com/nthnca/containers)
