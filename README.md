- https://github.com/nthnca/customurls - This is a simple URL shortener that runs on AppEngine. I use this all the time, for example you probably followed the link http://go.nthn.ca/me to get to this page. I use shortened links all the time because if you give links easy to remember names it saves a significant amount of time. Also it is easy to set things up so that in Chrome all I have to type is "go me", and it automatically just works, awesome.
