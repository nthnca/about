# About Me - [nthnca](https://twitter.com/nthnca)

This is just a simple directory of some of the things I am currently interested in or things I have done over the years.

## HowTo/Etc

- [Chrome Book Setup](ChromeBook.md)

## Projects (somewhat sorted by most to least useful)

- [Recipes](https://github.com/nthnca/recipes/blob/master/README.md) - Food. Family recipes, just started using github for this. Makes it easy to add/update/organize these over time. Also allows us to share these with our children/family/friends.
- [URL Shortener](https://github.com/nthnca/customurls/blob/master/README.md) - This is a simple URL shortener that runs on AppEngine. I use this all the time, for example you probably followed the link http://go.nthn.ca/me to get to this page. I use shortened links all the time because if you give links easy to remember names it saves a significant amount of time. Also it is easy to set things up so that in Chrome all I have to type is "go me", and it automatically just works, awesome.
- https://github.com/nthnca/dotvim - My VIM configuration.
- https://github.com/nthnca/dotbash - My bash/linux configuration.
- https://github.com/nthnca/curator - Simple little tool for managing my photos. Clunky but works for me.
